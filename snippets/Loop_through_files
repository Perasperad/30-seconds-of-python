One by one it reads all the files of a type contained in the folder where the script is being launched.
This can be used for any task you want to do with files, for example you may want to read their content and print it inside a new text file.

```py
from pathlib import Path
import os

source = os.getcwd() # folder path

def read_files():
      for path in Path(source).glob("*.jpg"):
        with path.open("rb") as file:
          ...
          print(path)
          ...
```

```py
read_files() 
# 'C:/whatever/file1.jpg'
# 'C:/whatever/file2.jpg'
etc. etc.
```
